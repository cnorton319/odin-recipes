    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My all time favorite homemade mac and cheese recipe. Creamy cheesey macaroni noodles topped with a crispy layer of cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sharp cheddar cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the macaroni until just tender, about 8-10 minutes, and drain</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Butter a 2 quart casserole dish, then layer half the macaroni over the bottom, followed by a layer of half the cheese slices, then a layer of the remaining macaroni</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the eggs, 1/2 cup of milk and the melted butter, season with salt and pepper and stir until well blended</li>
        <li>Top with remaining cheese slices and add just enough milk to cover all the macaroni but not the top layer of cheese</li>
        <li>Bake until the custard is slightly firm and the top lightly browned, 25-30 minutes</li>
    </ol>
